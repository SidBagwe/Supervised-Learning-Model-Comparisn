The project aims at understanding different supervised learning methods and comparing them using the Solar_coverage dataset.

Dataset Desription
The structure of the dataset shows us how our data is defined. We have 15 variables with 10926 observations with the solar_system_coverage as a factor and all the other variables as numerical and int.

Supervised Learning Models used
Logistic Regression
Classification Tree
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines.

The aim is to understand different models and tune them using the hyperparameteres. Finally, predictions are made using the best set of hyperparameters for each model and all the models are compared to check which model gives the best prediction on the test data.
